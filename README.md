It's util for debugging embeeded projects with some gui's.

Emulator has all methods, that have Adafruit screen libraries, and more another.

With this util you can debug your gui's on your pc, that is more efficient then on hardware.

    SE_MAIN emu(width, height);
    //Init with your shader folder (If shader dirrectory in the same path with executable, you don't need type path, just init())
    if(emu.init("..\\screen_emulator\\shaders\\")){
        while(emu.getWindowWorker()){
            emu.clear();

            //Draw graphics here
